# Train Scheduler Project

## Summary and Goals

The Train Scheduler is an app that allows users to create and update fictional trains. The Train Scheduler app begins with a form that requests the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency. Once entered, the train is stored in Firebase and placed in the current train schedule. The frequency, arrival time, and minutes away is determined by MomentJS.
